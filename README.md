# H1N1-Vaccination-Prediction

## Project Goal
Perform ML model to predict people getting vaccine 
(H1N1 Vaccine, Seasonal Flu vaccine)
Classification: binary labels (Yes, No)
Regression: numeric probability 
Potential Interest:
What attributes are valuable for vaccination prediction

In our anticipated results, weâ€™d like to determine the features that would have impact on the choice whether people would take the h1n1 vaccination or not. We try to split features into two categories, one is the status features, like whether people have health insurance, whether they are employed or not and their education level. The other is the behavior features, for example, if people wear face mask or wash hands after coming home would they tend to take the vaccination? Do people attend large gathering would have impact on the choice to take the vaccination?
